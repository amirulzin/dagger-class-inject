# Dagger Class Inject 


### Preface
For the majority of Dagger users, you don't exactly need this library. Simply provision your Java `Class` object 
in a `@Provider` method in a valid Dagger `@Module` and call it a day e.g.

````java
@Module
public interface SomeModule {
    @Provider
    static Class<SomeTool> providesSomeToolClass(){
        return SomeTool.class;
    }
}
````


However, if you've been doing constructor injection as a good DI citizen, you probably start hating yourself
when the need arise where you want to inject the Java `Class` object itself. Normally, having a few of them is fine. 
However, once it began to balloon up as per your project complexity, you'll probably start looking for a solution to eliminate the tedium. 
Hence, this library is born. 

### Usage
This library automatically generate valid Dagger `Class`  providers for Java classes annotated with `@ClassInject`.
These providers are then written into Dagger `@Module`, which are all graphed into a root module.
Root module named as `ClassProvidersModule` is created in the package wherever `@ClassInjectOrigin` is annotated.
 
Gradle:
````groovy
repositories {
   jCenter()
}

dependencies {
    implementation 'com.redconfig:class-inject-api:0.1.0'
    annotationProcessor 'com.redconfig:class-inject-processor:0.1.0'
}
````
 
 Declaration site:
````java
package com.awesomepackage.deep.nested;

@ClassInject
public class SomeTool { ... }
````
````java      
package com.awesomepackage;
 
@ClassInjectOrigin
public class SomeApp { ... }
````
 After generation:
````java
package com.awesomepackage.deep.nested;
@Component(modules = {
    ClassProvidersModule.class //generated by the library
})
public interface SomeAppComponent { ... }
````
 
 Injection site:
````java
package com.awesomepackage.deep.nested;
     
public class SomeGenericTool {
    @Inject
    public SomeGenericTool(Class<SomeTool> someToolClass){ //tada!
        ...
    }   
    
    public SomeTool doSomethingWithClass(){
        return parseSomething(someToolClass); 
    }       
}
